vim-web2py is a lightweight web2py plugin for vim.

You can:

 * Switch between the current controller and its views and vice versa with :SWITCH (or :SW)

 * See the models and the controllers in the current project and:
    * Open a controller with "c" 
    * Open a view with "v" 
    * Open a model with "o" 

The controllers and their views are merged in order to have a denser interface.
